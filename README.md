# MAMA-MIA Challenge 2025 – Final Submission Code

This repository contains the code for our final submission to the **MAMA-MIA Challenge 2025** (MICCAI 2025). The MAMA-MIA challenge focuses on two tasks using a large multi-center breast DCE-MRI dataset [1]:

1. **Primary Tumor Segmentation** in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans  
2. **Treatment Response Prediction**, specifically predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy from the MRI data  

We provide code for both tasks. The `sample_code_submission` folder includes the files submitted for the Validation phase and Test phase of the challenge.

## Segmentation (Task 1)

### Preprocessing

We selected three representative DCE-MRI time points as input channels: **Pre-contrast, First Post-contrast, and Second Post-contrast**. These phases are consistently available across all datasets. Preprocessing steps included:

1. **Cropping**: Bounding box cropping of MRI volumes and masks to the affected breast region.
2. **Z-score Normalization**: Percentile-based clipping and normalization using mean and std from the pre-contrast phase.
3. **Resampling**: All volumes resampled to isotropic spacing of **1×1×1 mm**.

The three normalized MRI phases were stacked into a multi-channel 3D volume for model input.

### Model Training

We used **nnU-Net** [2] with the **Residual Encoder Preset L** configuration [5] for segmentation. The training/validation split followed the official MAMA-MIA setup. We disabled nnU-Net's default normalization to retain our customized preprocessing. See the nnU-Net documentation for further details on residual encoder presets.

### Postprocessing

To map the predicted segmentation masks back to the original image space:

1. **Resample to original spacing**
2. **Restore original size** based on recorded cropping coordinates

All preprocessing scripts are available in `preprocessing/main.ipynb`.
All postprocessing scripts are available in `postprocessing/main.py`

## Treatment Response Prediction (Task 2)

All relevant functions for classification are located in the `machine_learning/` folder. Patients with unknown pCR labels were assigned to the non-pCR class.

### Preprocessing

Using the segmentation masks from Task 1:

1. Extract tumor regions from all available DCE-MRI phases.
2. Apply percentile clipping and Z-score normalization per image.
3. Stack images into a 4D volume.

### Feature Extraction

We extracted:

- **Temporal dynamics features** from the tumor region in 4D.
- **Shape radiomics** using the PyRadiomics library [3].

A `segmentation_failed` flag marks cases without detected tumors; these are assigned the non-pCR label.

### Classifier Training

We used **XGBoost** [4] with 5-fold stratified cross-validation to handle class imbalance. No explicit feature selection was applied. All extracted features were used.
